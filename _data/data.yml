  - role: Software Engineer Team Lead
    time: Apr 2019 - Nov 2020
    company: CNS Limited
    details: |
      Contributed as one of the team leads for a 3,000,000.00 (three million) USD valuation project. The project is "Consolidation, Integration, and Upgradation of CPAs' Existing ICT-based Facilities and Systems." I actively manage a team of software (Laravel experts) and database engineers and actively participate in designing the solution of six modules. These are Personnel Information Management System, Online Recruitment System, Provident Fund, Pension and Loan Management System, Electricity and Water Billing, Incident Management System, and Watchman Management System. I also integrated the PHP SOAP API with Oracle BI Publisher for reporting, and it makes the complex reporting system more manageable than ever! This solution even influences other projects, and they are also integrating this solution into their projects. Now, the company is considering this as a de-facto reporting requirement!
    technologies_used: |
      Laravel, Vuejs, Bootstrap 5, MySQL, Oracle, Javascript, Subversion, API, Swagger

  - role: Software Engineer
    time: May 2012 - Jan 2018
    company: Codemate Limited
    details: |
      Codemate Limited is a multi-national creative-tech company with roots in Finland. I worked as a software engineer here at the Bangladesh development team office.
      I was part of an ERP development team for a client of Codemate. The team developed the ERP solution using the Symfony2 framework. I contributed to the administration and billing modules. The administration module was responsible for managing the auth part as usual, and the billing module was for shared billing and partial billing for renting things.
      The Edita Prima Publishing company is well-known in Finland and Europe. They have multiple projects to convert their publishing business to the internet. I was an active team member of those projects like credita, edilex, and e-gate. With the help of XML libraries, I worked with the full-text search feature in OracleDB. I am also assigned to save users' search results and manage a paid newsletter service for paid subscribers.
      Another very successful project where I was involved is Ukko.fi. They provide a tax calculation service for lightweight entrepreneurs in Finland. They can be individual freelancers or small companies. Whenever they generate expense or travel cost invoices for work, the application calculates the tax according to the country's law and based on the document the user submits. The idea was excellent and effective for the business. But the company seriously struggles to survive because of its lousy web application. We go through the system and suggest what we will do for their improvement based on priority. The result of the project is that they are expanding their business in multiple countries, like Sweden, Russia, and Ethiopia!

      Symfony >=2, Zend Framework 1.8, Zend Framework 2, jQuery, Javascript, Zurb Foundation, Bootstrap, MySQL, ORACLE, Subversion, Git, Github, Bitbucket, Robot framework for test,
