  - role: Software Engineer
    time: May 2012 - Jan 2018
    company: Codemate Limited
    details: |
      Codemate Limited is a multi-national creative-tech company with roots in Finland. I worked as
      a Software Engineer here at Bangladesh development team office.
      I was a part of a ERP development team for a client of Codemate which developed on top of Symfony2
      framework. I contributed to Administration and Billing module. The administration module was
      responsible to manage auth part as-usual and the billing module was for shared billing, partial billing
      for renting things.
      Edita Prima Publishing company is well-known in Finland and Europe. They have mulitple projects to
      convert their publishing business to internet. I was active team member of those projects like credita,
      edilex and e-gate. I worked with full-text search feature in Oracle db with help of xml libraries. I am
      also assigned for saving search results for users and managing paid newsletter service for paid
      subscribers.
      Ukko.fi is another very much successful project where I involved. The provide tax calculation service
      for lightweight entreprenures in Finland. They can be individual freelancers or small companies.
      Whenever they generate expense or travel cost invoices for work the application calculates the tax by
      country law and based on the document user submits. The idea was nice and effective for the business.
      But they come to us at eleventh period when the business seriously struggles to survive just because of
      their bad web application. We go through the system and suggest what we will do for their
      improvement based on priority. We also suggest them about short-term and mid-term plan. Based on
      that the long term can be decided later. They agree and the result is when we handover the project
      they are not only the profitable business, they also expand their business in muliple countries like
      Sweden, Russia, Ethiopia!
