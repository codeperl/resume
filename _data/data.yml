  - role: Software Engineer Team Lead
    time: Apr 2019 - Nov 2020
    company: CNS Limited
    details: |
      Contributed as one of the team leads for a 3,000,000.00 (three million) USD valuation project. The project is "Consolidation, Integration, and Upgradation of CPAs' Existing ICT-based Facilities and Systems." I actively manage a team of software (Laravel experts) and database engineers and actively participate in the design of the solution of six modules. Those are: Personnel Information Management System, Online Recruitment System, Providend Fund, Pension and Loan Management System, Electricity and Water Billing, Incident Management System, Watchman Management System. I also integrated the PHP SOAP api with Oracle BI Publisher for reporting, and it really makes the complex reporting system easier than ever! Other projects are even influenced by this solution, and they are also integrating this solution into their projects. Now, the company is considering this as a de-facto reporting requirement!

      Laravel, Vuejs, Bootstrap 5, MySQL, Oracle, Javascript, Subversion, API, Swagger

  - role: Software Engineer
    time: May 2012 - Jan 2018
    company: Codemate Limited
    details: |
      Codemate Limited is a multi-national creative-tech company with roots in Finland. I worked as a software engineer here at the Bangladesh development team office.
      I was a part of an ERP development team for a client of Codemate, which developed on top of the Symfony2 framework. I contributed to the administration and billing modules. The administration module was responsible for managing the auth part as usual, and the billing module was for shared billing and partial billing for renting things.
      The Edita Prima Publishing company is well-known in Finland and Europe. They have multiple projects to convert their publishing business to the internet. I was an active team member of those projects like credita, edilex, and e-gate. With the help of xml libraries, I worked with the full-text search feature in OracleDB. I am also assigned to saving search results for users and managing a paid newsletter service for paid subscribers.
      Another very successful project where I was involved is Ukko.fi. They provide a tax calculation service for lightweight entrepreneurs in Finland. They can be individual freelancers or small companies. Whenever they generate expense or travel cost invoices for work, the application calculates the tax according to the country's law and based on the document the user submits. The idea was nice and effective for the business. But they come to us at the eleventh hour when the business seriously struggles to survive just because of their bad web application. We go through the system and suggest what we will do for their improvement based on priority. We also suggest they look at short-term and mid-term plans. Based on that, the long term can be decided later. They agree, and the result is that when we handover the project, they are not only a profitable business, they are also expanding their business in multiple countries, like Sweden, Russia, and Ethiopia!
